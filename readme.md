# Tic Tac Toe with Dynamic Move Cleaning

Tic Tac Toe is a classic game enjoyed by people of all ages. This project presents a unique twist on the traditional game: after the fourth move, the first move made by each player is automatically cleared. This dynamic mechanic adds an extra layer of strategy to the game, requiring players to think carefully about their moves in order to secure victory.

## How to Play

1. **Setup**: The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. **Objective**: The goal is to be the first player to get three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
3. **Turns**: Players take turns placing their symbols ('X' or 'O') on empty cells of the grid.
4. **Move Cleaning**: After each player's fourth move, their first move is automatically removed from the board.
5. **Victory**: The game ends when one player achieves a winning combination of three symbols in a row, or when the grid is full with no winner.
